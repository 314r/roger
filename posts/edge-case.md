# Edge Cases for Backlinks

This post explores some edge cases for the backlinks feature:

## Self-referential links

Here's a [link to this same post](edge-case.html) - should it create a backlink to itself?

## Multiple links to the same post

Here are two links to the [test post](test.html) and another [link to the test](test.html).

## Links with different text but same target

[First link to note](note.html) and [second link to the same note](note.html) with different text.

## Non-existent links

[This link](nonexistent.html) points to a post that doesn't exist.

## Return to [index](index.html)
